The refactoring strategy we are using is "Replace Array with Object". In the database, we have tables with different rows, and each row has different columns. For example, the table called "slim_elements_types_df" contains columns called "id", "plural_name", "singular_name", etc. In our code, we encapsulated the columns as different attributes of the class "position". We also had a table called "slim_teams_df", which contains the details regarding each team. We encapsulated each column of this table as different attributes of the class called "team". We did the same for a table called "slim_elements_df" and saved the attributes in a class named "player".
In this way, each row of the table will convert to a different object; instead of having a table, we only have a list of objects.
