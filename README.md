# SOEN6441_Project
This project is an implementation of an application for interacting with Football Fantasy pl API and sending some random requests to local database to get the desired outputs.
In this project we will mainly use python for our implementation
Sqlite was used to create and store the local database
the application comes up with 15-men shortlist when you you want to use your wildcard as a suggestion. It should be noted that every team in fpl cannot have more than 3players from a specific pl-team. SO we used this constraint in our code to come up with a reasonable team sheet.
